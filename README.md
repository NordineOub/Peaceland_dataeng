Project DATA ENGINEERING M1: Peaceland 

Peaceland is a country that aspires to bring peace, happiness and harmony to all its citizens. Its dedicated government wishes to achieve this goal by bringing peace to the country. A "peacewatcher" drone has been set up by engineers to fulfill this goal. The goal of this project is to create a program demonstrating the working architecture of peaceland, which will receive and manage the data from the drone.

-- How the project works--

The drone (producer) collects the data of the inhabitants of peaceland to send them to a consumer who transmits them to a datalake which will store the data of the drone, the alerts, so that peaceland can analyze them

The alerts (events): when the score of a person is lower than the threshold of tolerance, the drone which flies over the citizens with benevolence launches an alert with the position of the drone and the name of the person who needs to return towards a state of peace. This will place that person in a camp with a soothing program and he or she can then return to his or her normal life. If the camp's peace program is not sufficient, the person will be taken into a different program, which will allow them to go to a permanent state of peace.
